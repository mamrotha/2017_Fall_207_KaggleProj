    "There is a sub-reddit called [r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/) where users can post requests for someone to purchase them a pizza and, shockingly, random internet strangers will then buy them pizza.  In this competition, we are provided with a data set containing over 5,000 posts from this sub-reddit and our goal is to build a model that can predict whether or not the post will result in a pizza purchase."

All requests ask for the same thing: a free pizza. The outcome of each request -- whether its author received a pizza or not -- is known. Meta-data includes information such as: time of the request, activity of the requester, community-age of the requester, etc.\n",
